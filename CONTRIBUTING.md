Contributing to Forge
=====================

1) Keep patches to Minecraft classes minimal. If you need a lot of things done, you may either add to relevant forge classes or make a new class.

2) An example mod must be provided for all PRs adding events/hooks - either a full mod using your proposed hooks, or just a pastebin containing a simple example. Please also explain in detail what your new hook does.

3) You are not required to use a particular code style, but keep it readable and be consistent.
